 |PAGE INITIALIZATION										|
 |The page initialization section runs 3 different			|
 |functions in order to make sure the page is properly		|
 |formatted upon opening. It include checkEnabledFF and		|
 |checkEnabledThinning and also runs a function that sets	|
 |all the form values to the default values upon opening	|
 |the page.													|
 |															|
 |FORM SIZE SNAPPING										|
 |The form size snapping section contains the initial		|
 |snapping check for when the page is loaded and a			|
 |function for when the page is resized. Both do the same	|
 |thing but are called at separate events. The regular		|
 |if else statement is called upon on the initial loading	|
 |of the page where as the function is called upon when 	|
 |the page is resized and simply contains the same if else	|
 |statement. This statement looks at the width of the		|
 |window and adjusts the size of the form to predetermined	|
 |sizes rather than having it adjust automatically and		|
 |leaving a lot of blank gray space.						|

 |INITIAL CONDITIONS FUNCTIONS								|

 |-INITIAL CONDITIONS TEXTBOX-								|
 |This function is used to disable and clear unused text	|
 |from the Initial Conditions textboxes when a different	|
 |option is selected from the Drop Down box. Each option	|
 |has a value assigned to it from 0 to 3. When a change to	|
 |the drop down box occurs it checks to see the value of 	|
 |the selected option and changes the text boxes			|
 |accordingly by either adding or removing the disabled		|
 |attribute.												|
 |															|
 |-HARDWOOD COLLAPSE-										|
 |This function uses a Jquery Effect to create a simple		|
 |sliding animation when you click on the Hardwood			|

 |Collapse container.										|
															|
 |-checkEnabledFF-											|
 |This function is used to enable and disable the Fusiform	|
 |elements depending on if the enableFusiform checkbox is	|
 |checked off or not. Upon being called it checks to see	|
 |if the checkbox is checked. If it isnt then the 3			|
 |textboxes attain the disabled attribute. If the box is	|
 |checked then it removes the disabled attribute from the	|
 |3 textboxes.												|
															|
 |-FUSIFORM CHECKBOX-										|

 |-checkEnabledThinning-									|
 |Similar to the checkEnabledFF function this function		|
 |checks whether the checkbox is checked or not. In this	|
 |case when the checkbox is not checked it gives the		|
 |select element the disabled attribute and changing the	|
 |pointer events css attribute for the add and delete		|
 |buttons to none. This makes it so that clicking on the	|
 |buttons does not result in a click event. To give a		|
 |visual cue that the buttons are disabled we also give		|
 |them the css attribute of having grey background colors.	|
 |If the checkbox is enabled all these changes are			|
 |reversed and the buttons are given back their red color.	|

 |thinnings in the select element and return them as a		|
 |complete string. First it makes an Array from the select	|
 |options. If the arrays length is 0 then it returns a		|
 |a blank string. If no then it runs through the array		|
 |using a for loop and adds each element of the array onto	|
 |the end of the string. When the for loop is done it		|
 |returns the completed string of thinnings.				|
 |															|
 |-THINNING DIALOG INITIALIZATION-							|
